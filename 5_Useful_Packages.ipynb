    "The number of registered packages in the [General](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/Registry.toml) registry is quite vast (about 5500 on **30/04/2021**) and growing every day. So if you have a reasonably standard problem you want to solve, there is a good chance that someone has already made an effort. Even if that's not the case the composability between packages enabled by the Julia language implies that often building blocks from other packages can be easily reused as well. There is also a [great search engine](https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages) for Julia packages.\n",

    "To give you some ideas about the community and what is available, here is a non-exhaustive list, which is naturally influenced by my own background. I'm happy to adapt it, if you feel something is wrong / missing.\n",

It watches your filesystem for changes to a Julia package or script and reloads it automatically in the current REPL / Jupyter kernel. If you are the developer of a Julia package or usually find yourself coding in one terminal and using the code in another, this package is indispensable.\n",
    "- [JuliaFormatter](https://github.com/domluna/JuliaFormatter.jl): Basic automatic source-code formatter for Julia.\n",
    "- [Infiltrator](https://github.com/JuliaDebug/Infiltrator.jl): Drop into an interactive REPL at an arbitrary place in your code. Great for debugging and testing.\n",
    "- [Debugger](https://github.com/JuliaDebug/Debugger.jl): A gdb-like Julia debugger, which I use every day.\n",
    "- [Rebugger](https://github.com/timholy/Rebugger.jl): Another debugger. Preferred over Debugger by some people.\n",
    "- [Juno](https://junolab.org/): Not actually a package, but the development environment endorsed Julia computing.\n",
